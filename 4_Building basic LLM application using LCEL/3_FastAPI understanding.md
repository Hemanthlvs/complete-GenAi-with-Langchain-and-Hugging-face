# 📘 FastAPI vs Flask vs Streamlit — Simplified Notes

---

## 📌 What is an API?

**API = Application Programming Interface**

An API is like a **messenger** between two apps or systems.

### 🍕 Real-life example:

Imagine you're ordering food:

* You (customer) → tell the **waiter** what you want.
* The waiter → tells the **kitchen** to prepare it.
* The kitchen → gives it to the waiter.
* The waiter → gives it to you.

In the software world:

* Your **app** sends a request: `GET /menu`
* The **server** responds with: `{"items": ["Pizza", "Burger", "Pasta"]}`

✅ So, API helps two systems talk to each other and share data.

## 🚀 What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a **Python framework** used to build **APIs** (backend services).
It's **very fast**, supports modern Python, and automatically creates **API documentation**.

### ✅ Key Points:

* Built for **speed and performance**
* Supports **async/await** (non-blocking code)
* Generates **interactive docs** (Swagger UI)
* Best for **production APIs**

---

## 🌐 What is Flask?

Flask is another Python framework used to build **web apps and APIs**.
It is older and simpler than FastAPI, but **not as fast** or modern.

### ✅ Key Points:

* Simple to use
* Good for **small web apps and APIs**
* Slower and less feature-rich than FastAPI
* Does not create docs automatically

---

## 🖼️ What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is a tool to build **interactive dashboards and apps** for **data science and machine learning** projects.

### ✅ Key Points:

* Very easy to use
* You can build a **UI without HTML or JS**
* Best for **ML model demos**, **internal tools**, **data dashboards**
* Not built for APIs or big production apps

## 🔧 Real Business Use Cases

### 🏥 1. Doctor Appointment App

* **FastAPI**: Handles appointment booking APIs.
* **Flask**: Could also handle basic backend.
* **Streamlit**: Not suitable for this unless it’s just an internal tool.

### 🏘️ 2. House Price Prediction (ML)

* **Streamlit**: User enters data (sqft, location), sees prediction.
* **FastAPI**: Serve the ML model as an API.
* **Flask**: Same as FastAPI but with fewer features.

> ✅ You can combine Streamlit + FastAPI:
>
> * Streamlit UI collects input
> * Sends data to FastAPI API
> * FastAPI returns prediction

### 🛒 3. E-commerce App

* **FastAPI**: APIs for login, orders, payments.
* **Flask**: Possible, but may struggle at scale.
* **Streamlit**: Not suitable.

### 🧑‍💻 4. Internal Sales Dashboard

* **Streamlit**: Perfect for showing sales data, charts, filters.
* **FastAPI**: Can serve the data to the dashboard if needed.
* **Flask**: Possible, but Streamlit is easier here.

## 🧠 Streamlit Feels Like Backend Too? 🤔

Yes!

In **Streamlit**, you:

* Create input forms (e.g., number of rooms)
* Load a model in Python
* Show predictions in UI

But here's the difference:

| Part                       | **Streamlit**                          | **FastAPI / Flask**            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| UI + backend combined?     | ✅ Yes                                  | ❌ No (needs separate frontend) |
| API calls supported?       | ⚠️ Not built-in for calling other apps | ✅ Yes (designed for API usage) |
| Scalable / Production use? | ❌ Not ideal for large user-facing apps | ✅ Yes                          |
