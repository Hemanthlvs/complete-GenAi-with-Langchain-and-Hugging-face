# LangChain: Core Components for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## What is a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Application?

Basically, a RAG application helps you create a **document Q&A system**. Imagine you have a massive data source, like thousands of PDF files. If a user asks a question, your Gen AI application should be able to search through these PDFs and give a relevant answer.

**In simple terms:** User asks query -> Gen AI app searches data source (e.g., PDFs) -> Gen AI app gives response. This is a high-level overview of RAG.

## Core Components Used in LangChain for RAG Applications

We'll break this down into steps, understanding what components are used at each stage.

### Module 1: Data Processing & Storage

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   **Purpose:** This is the **first and most important step**. It involves loading your dataset from various sources.
    *   **Data Sources:** Can be anything like PDF files, Excel files, JSON files, images, videos, or even URLs.

2.  **Data Transformation (Text Splitting):**
    *   **Purpose:** After ingesting data, we need to **divide or split this data into smaller chunks** (text chunks or document chunks).
    *   **Why Split?** Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Google Gemini Pro, or open-source models (e.g., Llama 3) have a **limitation on the context size** they can process at once. If you feed too much data (e.g., from thousands of PDFs), it becomes too huge. Splitting ensures the data fits within the LLM's context window.
    *   **Component:** Data Transformation techniques for splitting chunks.

3.  **Text Embedding:**
    *   **Purpose:** We take the text chunks and **convert them into vectors**. This process is called embedding.
    *   **Why Vectors?** When you query a data source, algorithms like **similarity search** are used to find relevant information. These algorithms, often using **cosine similarity**, work by comparing vectors to find similar contexts or sentences. Text needs to be converted to vectors for these algorithms to work efficiently.
    *   **Embedding Techniques:** Different models (OpenAI, Google Gemini Pro, Hugging Face open-source models) have their own specific embedding techniques.
    *   **Component:** Embedding techniques.

4.  **Vector Store Database (Vector DB):**
    *   **Purpose:** Once text is converted into vectors, we need a place to **store these vectors**. This storage is called a **Vector Store Database**.
    *   **Examples of Vector DBs:** Popular ones include **Fais** (likely Faiss), **Chroma DB**, and **Astra DB**.
    *   **Functionality:** You can directly query this vector database to get context information, which is retrieved using similarity search.
    *   **Component:** Vector Store DB.

### Module 2: Querying & Generation

This module starts when a user asks a question, after the data has been processed and stored in the vector DB.

1.  **User Question & Prompt Template:**
    *   **User Question:** The query provided by the user.
    *   **Prompt Template:** A predefined message or instruction given to the LLM. This template tells the LLM **how to behave or act** (e.g., "Act as an AI researcher").
    *   **Combination:** The user's question is combined with this prompt template.

2.  **Retrieval Chain:**
    *   **Purpose:** This is an **interface responsible for querying the Vector Store DB**.
    *   **Process:** When a user asks a question, this question is first sent to the vector store. The Retrieval Chain queries the vector store, retrieves relevant context information (similar data from the PDFs based on the query).
    *   **Context Info:** This is the relevant data picked up from the stored documents that matches the user's query.
    *   **Component:** Retrieval Chain (which may include Document Store Load Chain as a part).

3.  **LLM Model (Large Language Model):**
    *   **Purpose:** To generate the final output response.
    *   **Input:** The LLM receives the combined information: the prompt template, the user's original question, and the context information retrieved from the vector store.
    *   **Output:** The LLM processes this input and generates the final answer or response.
